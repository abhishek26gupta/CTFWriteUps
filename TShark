Install tshark on linux using
sudo apt install tshark

2. run this command to read a file

tshark -r dns.cap

3. Run this command to check the no of packets captured in a cap file

tshark -r dns.cap | wc -l

4 . tshark -r dns.cap -Y “dns.qry.type == 1” is used to get A DNS records.


Now the main Task start Download the file and save as dns.pcap

tshark -r dns.cap | wc -l : run this command to find no of packets
tshark -r dns.pcap -Y “dns.flags.response==0” | wc -l : it gives DNS queries only excluding responses

3. tshark -r dns.pcap -Y “dns.flags.response==0” -T fields -e dns.id : search for specific DNS id field


4. tshark -r dns.pcap -Y “dns.flags.response==0” -T fields -e dns.qry.name | awk ‘{print substr($0, 1, 1)}’ | tr -d ‘\n’ : removing new lines and taking only 1st letter or the query name as that looks like a string we want for our next question


5. I used an online site to get the flag we have to decode the string we get in previous task

dcode.fr/cipher-identifier
